It seems they keep metadata in GPFS?

* PLFS

http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~johnbent/Pubs/bent_hppio14.pdf

* OrangeFS

Part of kernel mainline now.

* GPFS

* Scality


* IBM Storage Tank

SAN-based distributed object storage system for use in heterogeneous
environments.

* Ceph

- Cannot run on S3, Carlos confirmed it. It seems they are not even thinking about it.
Their internal object protocol relies on PATCH and other things.

* IBM Cleversafe has a contractor working on file system interface on top
of object storage. The code name of the project is cardinal. We need
to contact them through Larry.


* Lawrence Livermore lab has a number of projects that merge burst buffers,
object, and file system. Marfs and some ephemeral staff Kunal has mentioned.
He said there are paper published also.

* EMC Maginatics
we need to know more about it

* EMC ISILON

* EMC ATMOS 

* s3fs

* Michael Factor, Deep Learning, File system on object storage

* The XtreemFS architecture â€“ a
case for object-based file systems
in Grids
